Pagination is a technique used in web development to divide large datasets into smaller, manageable pages. It improves performance and user experience by displaying data in a structured format with navigation links to access different sections of the data. Pagination is commonly used for search results, product listings, and comments to prevent information overload and slow loading times. It involves server-side data retrieval and client-side rendering using JavaScript and HTML.
